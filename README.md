This repository contains my Docker Compose setup for my homelab and media server.
It’s mainly a personal backup but also shared here so friends (and anyone else interested) can reuse or adapt it for their own setups.
📌 About
This project includes:
A backup of my Docker Compose configuration files
Services and containers I use for my media server and homelab
A way to quickly redeploy my setup if needed
⚠️ Note:
This repo is not a step-by-step guide. It’s my personal configuration, so you may need to adjust paths, ports, or environment variables for your own use case.
